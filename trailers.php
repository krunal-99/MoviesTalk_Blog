                            When the soldiers of a despotic governing power approach a tranquil colony on the edge of the galaxy, Kora (Sofia Boutella), a mystery stranger living among the villagers, turns out to be their greatest chance for survival. Kora, a former member of the Imperium, is fully aware of what occurs to the locals when the group next returns to exploit them. She encourages the locals to rise up and take action against the government, which is clearly out to destroy their community’s land.

                            When it comes to Dune, the world that author Frank Herbert created in his first book was so vast, and immensely detailed that it was no surprise when the idea of turning the story into two cinematic parts came to fruition. This gives the plot a chance to breathe, and it can also give fans an in-depth, and highly detailed look at such an interesting society, without it feeling overly rushed.
