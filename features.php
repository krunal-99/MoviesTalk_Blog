The Ahsoka premiere episodes on Disney Plus gave fans a whole new world of Star Wars. But while it was a brand new story, continuing from the Star Wars: Rebels animated series, there were a lot of familiar moments. In many ways, Ahsoka homages Star Wars in the most brilliant of ways, but also adds some nostalgic touches to a new show.

                        <p class="post__body">
                            Chris Spencer’s Back on the Strip sets out on a premise that could have been a unique exploration of ambition, identity, and self-discovery. Unfortunately, the film falls far short of its potential. The result is a disjointed and uninspired narrative that struggles to find its footing. With a cast boasting Wesley Snipes, Tiffany Haddish, and JB Smoove, you would expect a fun time at the movies. Back on The Strip disappoints on multiple fronts.

                            David Fincher has casually created one of the best directing portfolios in cinematic history. All of his outings are vastly different, showing that he doesn’t just need to stick to one formula to be successful. From The Social Network to Zodiac, to Seven & of course Fight Club, it’s been a monumental and diverse run. That path continues right now with The Killer!

                        <p class="post__body">
                            When Jurassic Park stomped its way onto the big screen back in July of 1993, viewers were just not ready to have their lives completely changed (For the better!). No one had seen anything of this size before, and it was also one of the first big blockbusters to really push the process of CGI forward.

                        <p class="post__body">
                            Director Nimród Antal’s Retribution attempts to capitalize on the tension of a high-stakes thriller, featuring Liam Neeson in the lead role as Matt Turner. The film promises a heart-pounding premise: a man forced into a perilous situation by a mysterious caller, where he must follow a series of dangerous tasks to save his family from a ticking bomb. While the concept holds potential, the execution leaves much to be desired, resulting in a film that struggles to maintain its suspense and engage the audience. Read on for my non-spoiler Retribution review.
