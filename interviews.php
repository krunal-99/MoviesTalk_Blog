                        <p class="post__body">
                            “Heir of the Witch” is a new horror movie by first-time feature filmmaker Victoria U. Bell. The malevolent spirit of a witch terrorizes a woman, viciously murdering anyone who attempts to get close to her.

Writer, director, and star Victoria U. Bell’s own life experiences are purportedly reflected in this viscerally chilling new horror chronicle.  Bell maintains that her grandmother was, in fact, a Moldovan witch.

Bell talks candidly about…
her first feature, and about the dark family heritage from which this truly terrifying tale emanates.  As she did with me recently for my YouTube Channel.
